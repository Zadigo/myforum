                Ban Appeal

                Who can appeal:

                Any TF user who received a ban (incl. perma bans)
                No appeals on behalf of other members will be accepted
                No appeals for Permaban lift will be accepted from Double Accounts

                No appeal possible for:

                self requested bans
                bans decided by the webmasters (steve), in this case please use the "contact us" button to contact steve directly!

                How to appeal:

                Contact us via TFBanAppeal@hotmail.com within 1 week after receiving the ban and make sure to add your username to your message.
                Explain in your text why you believe that you should not have been banned.

                The possible outcomes of an appeal:

                All moderators will review the request.
                If the majority of the moderation team (consisting of administrators and supermods) agrees with the appeal the ban will be overturned.
                If the majority of the moderation team (consisting of administrators and supermods) rejects the appeal then the ban will remain.

                The result of the appeal, as well as the reasons for the final decision, will be communicated to the member who has appealed.

                A re-appeal for the same case is not possible!
